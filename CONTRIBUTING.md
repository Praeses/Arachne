# Contributing to Arachne

So you wish to contribute, eh? That's cool. Here are some guidelines to
hopefully make your contribution experience  a pleasant and productive one.

## Code of Conduct

See our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

Let's face it, even the best of us produce bugs from time to time. If you find a
bug in our library, let us know. We'll do what we can to track it down and fix
it if we can. We will accept bug reports via the GitHub issue system.

### Suggesting Features

This project is currently in its earliest of stages. We are not currently open
to implementing new features until we  have our core features implemented. That
doesn't mean we aren't open to suggestions for features to be implemented at a
later stage. We will accept feature suggestions via the GitHub issue system.

### Contributing Code

Want to get your hands dirty? That's also cool. If there are unclaimed issues
that you think you can wrap your head  around and solve then by all means go for
it. Be sure to fork the repository before you begin contributing. If you want
to, you can make a Pull Request back to our repository and we'll review it. We
do not guarantee that we'll accept all  Pull Requests sent our way. If your
desire is to contribute back to our code-base, we do ask that you get in contact
with us first. We'll have insight into our product's vision and the code-base,
so we'll be able to give you hints and  be able to advise you in such a way as
to increase the odds that your code will be accepted back into our code-base.

If you make a Pull Request to our code-base, please modify the CONTRIBUTERS.txt
file, and add the following information:

* Name (required)
* Valid Email (required)

#### Tests

We ask that you provide passing Unit Tests for any code you intend to contribute
to our code-base, if possible.
